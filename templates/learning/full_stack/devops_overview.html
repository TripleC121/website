        <h3>Reflections and Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
            Implementing DevOps practices has significantly improved my development workflow and the reliability of this project. Looking ahead, I plan to explore more advanced DevOps topics such as infrastructure as code with tools like Terraform, and dive deeper into monitoring and observability practices. I'm also interested in learning about GitOps and how it can further streamline the deployment process.
