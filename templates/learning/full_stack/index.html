                            <strong>Django:</strong> A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "battery-included" philosophy, providing a robust set of features out of the box, including an ORM, authentication, admin interface, and more. Django is known for its "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and its strong community support.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Gunicorn:</strong> Short for "Green Unicorn," it is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It's a pre-fork worker model, meaning it spawns multiple worker processes to handle requests. Gunicorn is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a popular choice for deploying Python web applications, including those built with Django. It acts as an interface between the web server (like Nginx) and the Python application, handling client requests and communicating with the application.
