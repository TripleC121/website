        <h3>Future Infrastructure Management Plans</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ansible:</strong> For automated configuration management and application deployment</li>
            <li><strong>Terraform:</strong> To create declarative, version-controlled infrastructure as code</li>
            <li>Goal: Achieve cloud-agnostic infrastructure management</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Benefits of Cloud-Agnostic Approach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased flexibility in choosing cloud providers</li>
            <li>Reduced vendor lock-in</li>
            <li>Consistent infrastructure management across different environments</li>
            <li>Improved disaster recovery and business continuity options</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h3>Integration with Full-Stack Development</h3>
        <p>This cloud-focused approach complements the full-stack development process by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring scalable and reliable infrastructure for application deployment</li>
            <li>Facilitating DevOps practices through infrastructure as code</li>
            <li>Enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of new features</li>
            <li>Providing a foundation for microservices architecture if needed in the future</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>By combining deep AWS knowledge with plans for cloud-agnostic tools like Ansible and Terraform, this approach demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of modern cloud infrastructure in the context of full-stack development. It showcases not just current skills, but also a forward-thinking approach to evolving technology landscapes.</p>
