        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <div class="grid">
            <a href="{% url 'project1' %}" class="card">
                <h4>Python Foundations</h4>
                <p>This project served to test two areas of learning:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Demonstration of Python programming for data science.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate Exploratory Data Analysis Expertise "EDA". EDA is an iomportant step in machine learning and artifical intelligence and is part of every project.</li>
                </ol>
            </a>
            <a href="{% url 'project2' %}" class="card">
                <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                <p>I built my first machine learning model. The project was to help a bank marketing department identify potential customers who aer likely to purchase a loan.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="{% url 'project3' %}" class="card">
                <h4>Advanced Machine Learning</h4>
                <p>In this project I built multiple advanced machine learning models and tested which would be the best fit for this use caase. The use case was to classify activities that would keep a customer from giving up their credit card.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="{% url 'project4' %}" class="card">
                <h4>Neural Network Optimization</h4>
                <p>In this project I built multiple Neural Network models and trained them with different optimizers, neurons, etc. to find the best model to predict customer churn for a bank.</p>
            </a>
            <a href="{% url 'project5' %}" class="card">
                <h4>Project 5: [Title]</h4>
                <p>Brief description of the project and its main focus.</p>

        <h3>Reflections and Future Directions</h3>
        <p>These projects have been instrumental in solidifying my understanding of AI and ML concepts.
        They've provided hands-on experience in tackling real-world problems, from data preprocessing
        to model deployment. Moving forward, I'm excited to delve deeper into advanced topics like
        reinforcement learning and generative AI, and to apply these skills to more complex, real-world challenges.</p>
