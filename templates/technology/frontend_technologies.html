        <h3>How These Frontend Technologies Work Together</h3>
        <p>Our frontend architecture is built on the solid foundation of HTML5, providing semantic structure to our content. CSS3 is used extensively for styling and creating responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. We leverage modern CSS features like Flexbox and Grid for advanced layouts, and use media queries to ensure a consistent experience across devices.</p>
        <p>While we keep JavaScript usage minimal, we employ it strategically to enhance interactivity and user experience. This includes handling user interactions, making asynchronous requests to our backend API, and dynamically updating content where necessary.</p>
        <p>Our frontend tooling, including Webpack and Babel, allows us to use modern JavaScript features while ensuring compatibility across browsers. PostCSS helps us optimize our CSS, while linting tools maintain code quality and consistency.</p>
        <p>This approach results in a frontend that is fast, responsive, and accessible, while remaining relatively simple and maintainable. By focusing on HTML5 and CSS3, with judicious use of JavaScript, we create a user interface that is both modern and widely compatible.</p>
