            <h3>Docker</h3>
            <p>We use Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Containers for Django app and Nginx</li>
                <li>Consistent environments across stages</li>

            <h3>GitHub Actions</h3>
            <p>Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, automating our build, test, and deployment processes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated testing on pull requests</li>
                <li>Automated deployments to production</li>

            <h3>Nginx</h3>
            <p>Nginx serves as our web server and reverse proxy, handling incoming requests and serving static files efficiently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reverse proxy for Django application</li>
                <li>Efficient serving of static files</li>

            <p>We use AWS Systems Manager for secure, automated deployments to our EC2 instances.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure, remote execution of deployment scripts</li>
                <li>Integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD</li>
                <li>Automated application updates</li>

        <h3>How These Technologies Work Together</h3>
        <p>Our application and its dependencies are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across environments. GitHub Actions automates our CI/CD pipeline, running tests on pull requests and triggering deployments when changes are merged to the main branch. The deployment process uses AWS Systems Manager to securely execute deployment scripts on our EC2 instances, updating the Docker containers with the latest code. Nginx, also running in a Docker container, acts as a reverse proxy, directing traffic to the Django application container and serving static files. This integrated approach allows for rapid, reliable, and secure deployments of our web application.</p>
