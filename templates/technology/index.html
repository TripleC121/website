        <h3>How It All Works Together</h3>
        <p>This technology stack creates a robust and scalable web application ecosystem. Django handles server-side logic, interacting with PostgreSQL for data persistence. Gunicorn serves the Django application, while Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and handles static files. The frontend is built with responsive HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for enhanced user interactions.</p>
        <p>The entire application is containerized using Docker and hosted on AWS EC2, with AWS RDS managing the database and S3 for static file storage. GitHub Actions automate the testing and deployment process, using AWS Systems Manager for secure and efficient deployments. This setup ensures code quality, easy updates, and robust infrastructure management.</p>
        <p>This combination of technologies represents current industry best practices, offering benefits such as scalability, maintainability, and efficient development workflows. Each component has been chosen for its strengths and how well it integrates with the others, creating a powerful and flexible foundation for web application development.</p>
